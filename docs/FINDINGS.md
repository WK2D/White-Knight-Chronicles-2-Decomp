# Findings

Updated 2026-10-16. Target: White Knight Chronicles II, USA BLUS30784 v01.00.

## Goal and reporting

Develop native Windows C/C++ execution through the title screen, gameplay and
verified save/load, with an architecture suitable for later Apple Silicon work.
Completion remains unproven until those behaviors have been tested.
Start gameplay validation with White Knight Chronicles I, included on the disc.

Maintain this log as research progresses. Publish checked code, concise findings
and new verified screenshots together when a meaningful milestone is reached.
Keep full traces, generated game code, assets and local paths in the private workspace.

## Implemented fixes

- Correct lightweight-condition layout and wait/signal behavior.
- Allocate and account for memory-container allocations instead of acknowledging
  allocation without providing memory.
- Support large archive offsets and authenticated, atomic SDAT caches.
- Lift observed heap-backed SPU jobs and avoid duplicate synthetic completions.
- Preserve SPU-produced FIFO segments while their producer fills them.
- Bind all 16 fragment texture units, preserve inline constants, and use the
  current shader-decompiler interfaces.
- Publish event queues only after host synchronization objects are initialized.
- Wait for a pending background content check before entering the original
  installation request, preventing that request from being dropped.
- Implement the nine imported PAMF reader APIs with guest-endian fields,
  64-bit file sizes, actual stream descriptors and copyable guest reader state.
- Parse MPEG program-stream packets incrementally and assemble MPEG-2, LPCM and
  AC-3 access units across packet and input-buffer boundaries.
- Supply demux work-memory queries, guest-resident AU records and payloads,
  guest callback messages, queue backpressure, flush and release lifetimes.
- Give callback threads separate guest stack slots, with separate slices for
  nested callbacks and slot reuse when host threads exit.
- Implement imported Vpost open/query/close/exec interfaces, with the actual
  argument/field layout and progressive YUV420 crop, bilinear resize and RGBA output.
- Enable real FFmpeg MPEG-2 decoding using pinned public headers and a separately
  supplied library. The optional decoder check reports a skip if no library loads.

Regression checks cover real video decoding, sparse video timestamps, LPCM sample
conversion/concurrent queues, stereo/surround AC-3, Vpost conversion/windows, callback
stacks, demux ABI/lifetimes, packet/access-unit parsing, PAMF reader ABI, lightweight conditions, memory containers, LFQueue and
event-queue recycling. PAMF checks use synthetic video/audio descriptors,
including declared data larger than 4 GiB, copied readers and malformed headers.
An optional private-header check also passes against the first logo file.
Their scope is narrower than full-game compatibility.

## Startup investigation

Later startup frames are black. A captured late command batch contains a black
clear and the final composite, without title-scene draws. The update dispatcher
continues executing its callbacks, so a global pause of the update loop does not
explain this sample.

Tracing then found an installation request arriving while a check-only request
was still pending. The guest helper rejected it, leaving startup waiting for
installation work that had never begun. An isolated empty emulated HDD alone
reproduced the same wait.

Synchronization before the original install request lets the check finish first.
The original guest installer then allocates its buffer, copies the data archives
and advances startup. Whole-file hashes verify the three large installed archives. A second run from
an empty isolated emulated HDD, with detailed tracing disabled, reproduces the
installation and all three matching archive hashes.
No completion result or installation progress was fabricated.

## Current startup status

AC-3 decoding removes the audio-open failure after the startup logos. The file
trace identifies the previously blocked clip as `title02.pam`, the animated title
background. The native title screen displays New Game, Continue and Options.
With no controller input after the startup notices, it enters `wk2rush.pam`, the
attract movie. The [gallery](GALLERY.md) includes the rendered title menu.

The asynchronous video bridge separates pending compressed inputs from decoded
output capacity, preventing the earlier busy/callback deadlock. Both LPCM and AC-3
use real samples, per-output guest records and sample-count-based timestamps.
The game requests six-channel AC-3 output in the observed run. Synthetic stereo
and 5.1 checks pass; all samples from the opening stream and title background
match an independent FFmpeg elementary-stream decode across two sequence starts.
See the [sample counts and hashes](../verification/movie-demux.json).

The AC-3 comparisons cover sample conversion, requested downmix/channel order,
input copies, output backpressure and reset. They do not independently validate
container audio demux or prove identical output to original console hardware.
Live controller input changes the title highlight and opens New Game. Description,
game-selection and confirmation text now render correctly. The font atlas is a
2048x1024 linear A4R4G4B4 texture, with a 4096-byte row pitch. The earlier binding
filter excluded this format, so text draws sampled the previous artwork. Recording
the actual texture and using the shared decoder plus the uploaded DXGI format fixes
the observed menus. The build now runs the SDK texture-layout tests as well.

White Knight Chronicles I was selected and confirmed through the controller path.
The previous loading attempt dispatched a 258,688-byte all-zero image because
its guard had never registered: the fixed host table was full and an unknown
guard incorrectly released the chain. The importer rejects that empty capture.
The runtime now allocates guard entries, tracks the owning chain, synchronizes
notifications/reset/waits and releases entries after joining. It does not dispatch
past an unknown guard. A cleanup-only fix still hit the 32-guard cap, confirming
that simultaneous capacity mattered as well as lifetime.

The regression test covers 100 create/run/shutdown/join cycles, two-notification
waits, reset, queued notifications, 128 simultaneous guards and invalid guards.
The previous implementation fails this test. The native WKC1 attempt now registers
the formerly missing guards and reaches a real 11,856-byte SPU program
(fingerprint 6AEA19F8490A2656). Its private static lift finds 123 functions and
98.2% code coverage, with seven undecoded words. A subsequent native WKC1 run
traces eight dispatches of this program, all returning `rc=0`. No unregistered-job
warning appears in that run. This verifies dispatch/return, not output correctness:
the game subsequently reports a graphics/FIFO error and stalls. Inspect the
produced command buffers and FIFO consumption next. Playable scenes and save/load
remain unverified.

## Update 1.01 and DLC integration

Planned scope includes the USA 1.01 update and matching DLC. Local package
inspection confirms update TITLE_ID BLUS30784 and APP_VER 01.01. It contains a
replacement executable, patch settings and an approximately 199 MB patch archive.
The USA DLC metadata also targets BLUS30784; a separate European package targets
BCES01085. Its regional differences are part of the planned DLC investigation.

A byte comparison of the supplied DLC packages finds 21 USA entries and 22 EU
entries under `USRDIR/cm`. The EU-only entry is `c1267f66.edat` (320 bytes).
Nine shared files are byte-identical; twelve differ. Package-level differences
can include licensing/container metadata, so this does not yet identify an extra
item, quest or other playable feature. Determine what the extra entry unlocks,
compare the differing shared entries, and test any relevant content against the
USA build before claiming compatibility.

Next steps are to analyze the updated executable, integrate the patch data and
DLC discovery, and validate content access plus gameplay/save compatibility.
The current baseline remains disc v01.00. Neither 1.01 execution nor DLC content
has been verified in the native port. Package bytes and local source locations
are not published.

## Still unverified

Playable scenes, combat, save/load, a complete fresh-disc
reproduction of the latest boot, macOS execution and online functionality.

See the [build limitations](BUILD.md) and [capture manifest](../verification/gallery.json)
for reproduction requirements and screenshot provenance.
